This problem right away screamed to use [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data). I wasn't sure how much time I'd be able to spend on it so I figured that I should brute force the solution and then figure out how to do it in a more performant manner. Puzzle 1 was easy enough but I got stuck on Puzzle 2 thinking that I could be more clever than just creating permutations of each report. It was getting late so I cut my losses and just did the brute force solution to get the results. I still want to write a SIMD solution in either C or numpy if I have the time. For puzzle 1 it should be pretty trivial, for puzzle 2 I am not sure. It would be a cool example of where Python will be so much faster than something like JS. I believe there's no way to force SIMD processing in node unless it decides to optimize and use it. Could be an interesting problem - figure out how to write node so that it does trigger SIMD processing.
