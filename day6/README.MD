Part 2 is funny. I originally thought that hitting O from the same direction twice is the loop trigger. Since I did part 1 recursively, in part 2 I was getting a stack overflow. I got an infinite loop. I traced it to a specific scenario where the loop happened just between # and not O. At that point I realized that my constraint is incomplete but the most obvious thing to test that was to just cound the number of iterations and if it's high enough, assume that it's a loop. I didn't expect that to work but it did. That makes me realize that the only logic I could have used is the loop count. This made me think of AI. The amount of wasted energy is colossal but we do get the results we were looking for. It made me think about human vs machine efficiencies. I am leaving a 'bad' solution for puzzle 2. It got the right result and I think it's more novel than the right solution.
